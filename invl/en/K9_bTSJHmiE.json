      "text": "whats up tech central here and welcome to a brand new video on the channel today we will take a in depth look at my gaming slash editing pc build for the channel. So without further a dew lets get started, so i know alot of people in the comment section of the timelapse video said that the build was well over $500, guys prices fluctuate daily and thier is nothin i can do about it, i sourced half of the parts from amazon and the other half from Micro Center to make it a $500 gaming pc build.  All the parts used in this build will be linked down below in the description box, so for the motherboard i went with the MSI 970A SLI Krait Edition, this motherboard is capable of overclocking the cpu and really good for sli builds, i bought this motherboard for $54 from micro center but thier was a mail in rebatefor $15 that brought the price down to $39. For the cpu i went with the amd fx 8320e processor, this cpu has a base clock of 3.2 ghz and a turbo clock of 4 ghz. i didnt overclock this processor yet because i am planning on doing a full video on how to overclock amd cpus so stay tuned for that but i got this processor for $90 from microcenter. next up for ram i went with 8 gb of ddr3 memory clocked at 1866 mghz these are from Kingston the HyperX FURY series. i got this for $60 off of amazon. and for storage i went with a 240 gb ssd from drevo this is the xi series and this ssd id super fast for boot ups and running other applications. at the tim i got this for $75 off of amazon. for the graphics card i went with the gtx 1050ti from evga it tends to go for 140$ but i snagged this one for $115. this is a really good budget graphics card from nvidias 10 series lineup. i was deciding to go with an all amd build but after taking a look abenchmarks this gpu performs better in this price range. powering all of these components s the 500 watt power supply from EVGA ad everything is packed inside the ractal core 1000 case for the finest  is the 600 watt power supply from thermaltake which i got for $45, and everything is packed inside the NZXT s340 case which i got for $65. so since this is a gaming and editing pc i decided to include a render sample, so i rendered a 3 min video at 1080p 30fps and it rendered it in 6 minutes which in my opinion is 10 times better than my old pc which took about 30 minutes average to render videos in 720p 30 fps. so now that that is out of the way lets take a look at how this gaming pc performs whilst playing games.   Hopefully you guys enjoyed the benchmarks, make sure to leave like i will be uploading a how to build guide for this pc so if your not already subscribe to the channel, also follow me on twitter for sneak peaks on my next months pc build which i have already started to put together. thank you all so much for watching and i will see you all in the next video.
